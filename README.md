# Point-Cloud-Processing
In this project we will process point clouds for plane, sphere and cylinder fitting using RANSAC.

To Run the code:

# Plane fitting
1. By calculating the sample mean and covariancematrix of the points.
2. With outliers.
3. Using RANSAC and outliers.

python point_cloud.py -q <q1_a,q1_b,q1_c>

# Sphere fitting using RANSAC

python point_cloud.py -q q2

# Cylinder fitting using RANSAC


python point_cloud.py -q q3
